<p align="center">Offload modules to Worker threads seamlessly using <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink">Comlink</a>.</p>


### Features

- Offload almost any module into a Worker with little or no usage change
- Supports arbitrary classes, objects & functions (`await new Foo()`)
- Works beautifully with async/await
- Built-in code-splitting: workers are lazy-loaded


## Installation

```sh
npm install -D comlink-loader
```


## Usage

The goal of `comlink-loader` is to make the fact that a module is running inside a Worker nearly transparent to the developer.

In the example below, the sole difference between running `MyClass` on a Worker thread instead of the main thread is that instantiation and method calls must be prefixed with `await`. This is required because Worker interactions are inherently asynchronous.

**my-class.js**: _(gets moved into a worker)_

```js
// Dependencies get bundled into the worker:
import rnd from 'random-int';

// Export as you would in a normal module:
export class MyClass {
  constructor(value = rnd()) {
    this.value = value;
  }
  increment() {
    this.value++;
  }
  // Tip: async functions make the interface identical
  async getValue() {
    return this.value;
  }
}
```

**main.js**: _(our demo, on the main thread)_

```js
import { MyClass } from 'comlink-loader!./my-class';

const inst = await new MyClass(42); // notice the await

await inst.increment();

await inst.getValue();  // 43
```
